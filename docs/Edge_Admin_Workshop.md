Enterprise hybrid multicloud\. This region offers the classic enterprise\-level model storage and management\, device management\, and especially enterprise\-level analytics and dashboards\. This region can be hosted in the cloud or in an on\-premises data center\.

Edge network or micro data center\. New networking technologies have resulted in the edge network or micro data center\, which can be viewed as a local cloud for devices to communicate with\. The edge network reduces the distance that data from the devices must travel and thus decreases latency and bandwidth issues especially with the advent of 5G\. This region also offers more analytical capabilities and more storage for models\.

Edge servers are used to deploy apps to the devices\. They are in constant communication with the devices by using agents that are installed on each of the devices\. Thousands of edge servers maintain a pulse on the millions of devices\. If something more than inferencing is needed\, data from the devices is sent to the edge server for further analysis

Devices \- The edge and IoT devices are equipped to run analytics\, apply AI rules\, and even store some data locally to support operations at the edge\. The devices could handle analysis and real\-time inferencing without involvement of the edge server or the enterprise region\.

Deploy and manage critical workloads on edge nodes securely and reliably to hundreds of remote locations from a central location

Bring your app to the edge – variety of edge environments supported across market verticals

Seamless Integration with OpenShift to deploy containerized apps anywhere

Enables large data files such as machine learning model files to have an __independent lifecycle__ from the code that uses it\, like an inferencing application
