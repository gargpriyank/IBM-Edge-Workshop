# Edge Overview

__Introduction__

- Edge computing acts on data at the source â€“ usually at the first compute hop.

__Why edge?__

- Most common reasons for deploying applications on the edge are related to security 
  (early) and performance (low latency). Highly distributed applications like CDN have long used caching edges 
  for serving content.

__Types of Edges__

- Cloud edge
- IoT edge
- Mobile edge

__Considerations for Edge Application Design and Development__

- Manage your workloads across all clouds and on any number of devices.

- Deploy applications to all edge locations reliably and seamlessly.

- Maintain openness and flexibility to adopt to evolving needs.

- Operate more securely and with confidence.

__Why IBM Edge?__

- Manage the distribution of software at massive scale.

- Leverage open\-source technology.

- Address security concerns.

- Move to autonomous management that's built for scale and variability and runs anywhere.
