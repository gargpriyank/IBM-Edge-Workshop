# Edge Overview

## Introduction

- Edge computing is a distributed computing model and open information technology (IT) architecture.
- Edge computing drives applications, data and computing power services away from centralized points and towards places 
  that are closer to the user. This data is processed by a device or by a local computer or server instead of being 
  transmitted to a data center.
- The computation in edge computing is either largely or entirely performed on distributed device nodes. 
  Edge computing focuses on any application that needs to be closer to the source of the action where distributed 
  systems technology interacts with the physical world. Although it may interact with a centralized cloud, 
  edge computing doesn't need contact with a centralized cloud.
- Edge computing acts on data at the source, usually at the first compute hop.

## Why edge?

- Most common reasons for deploying applications on the edge are related to security and performance (low latency). 
  Highly distributed applications like CDN have long used caching edges for serving content.
- In edge computing data is inferenced on the edge as compared to IOT that sends the data to cloud for analyses, that helps to eliminate the 
  single point failure, reduce the latency and reduce the cost of data transmission.
  
## Considerations for Edge Service Design and Development

- Manage your workloads across all clouds and on any number of devices.
- Deploy applications to all edge locations reliably and seamlessly.
- Maintain openness and flexibility to adopt to evolving needs.
- Operate more securely and with confidence.
